## Python Files
The python files are written for Pyhon3 and require `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

The file `nys_mer.py` is doing the core algorithm, and `nys_sob.py` is for the experiments specific to periodic Sobolev spaces. You can see `nys_exp.py` for reproducing the experiments. Note that running the whole experiments for Figs. 1 and 2 would take up to half a day.

## Results Folder
The `results/` folder contains the results of our experiments; plots in pdf files and records of runtime of each algorithm in text files.
